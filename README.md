# personalblocklist
This is a personal blocklist, used to import into the Personal Blocklist extension by Google

The initial source of the entries in this list is from "False, Misleading, Clickbait-y, and Satirical “News” Sources" by Melissa Zimdars.  I have removed some of the original entries.  And I've added a few of my own.
This is the link to Ms. Zimdars list:

A few more resources that I've included:
http://fakenewswatch.com/
http://www.snopes.com
http://www.thatsfake.com/

Web sites get added if they publish deliberately false, misleading or click bait content.

Web sites get removed if:
1. they no longer exist,
2. they stop publishing false, misleading or click bait material.
